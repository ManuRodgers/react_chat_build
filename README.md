# react_chat_build
this is my personal project in order to practice skills and knowledge that I learned recently about Mongodb, Express, React, Node aka MERN stack, furthermore  I used redux as my state management library, socket.io to achieve real-time communication, react-router4 for single page application(SPA) and ant-design as react UI library to quickly create UI.

entry point: http://localhost:3000/login (it’s better to user chrome browser to see the result of app )
server: http://localhost:9093/
Basic idea of this project:  there are two kinds of users in this app, which are geniuses who want to find a job and bosses who want to find some people working for them. For example, if a genius login into this app then the boss list will be displayed and the corresponding company name, job requirement and salary will be shown to genius vice versa. What’s more? A genius can chat with those people in the boss list if this genius is interested in the job and salary provided by the boss and they can discuss the detailed information with one another.
By the way, if there are some weird situation happening in this app then you can reload the page to see whether it is working normally or not. Of course, If there are any issues please tell me as soon as possible.
