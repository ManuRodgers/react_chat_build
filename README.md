# react_chat_build
this is my personal project in order to practice skills and knowledge that I learned recently about Mongodb, Express, React, Node aka MERN stack, furthermore  I used redux as my state management library, socket.io to achieve real-time communication, react-router4 for single page application(SPA) and ant-design as react UI library to quickly create UI.
